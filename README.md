## üìã Overview

Nebula is an ambitious distributed file system project implemented in Rust that demonstrates advanced distributed systems concepts including:

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Files identified by their content hash rather than location
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized node network with no single point of failure
- **File Chunking**: Breaking large files into manageable pieces for efficient distribution
- **Distributed Hash Tables**: Kademlia-based DHT for efficient content routing
- **Data Deduplication**: Automatic detection and elimination of redundant data
- **Content Integrity**: SHA-256 based content addressing for cryptographic verification

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.76 or higher
- Git

### Installation & Usage

**Option 1: Build and Run Locally**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/T-silva15/Nebula.git
cd Nebula

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run commands using the built binary
./target/release/nebula start
./target/release/nebula put /path/to/file.txt
```

**Option 2: Install System-wide**
```bash
# Install directly from the repository
cargo install --path .

# Now use 'nebula' command anywhere
nebula start
nebula put /path/to/file.txt
nebula stats
```

**Basic Usage Examples**
```bash
# Start a node (interactive mode)
nebula start

# Start a node in background (daemon mode)
nebula start --daemon

# Store a file and get its ID
nebula put document.pdf

# Retrieve a file by ID (full UUID or 8-char short ID)
nebula get a1b2c3d4 retrieved_document.pdf

# View storage statistics and deduplication ratios
nebula stats

# List all stored files with metadata
nebula list-files --verbose
```

### Deduplication Testing
See [DEDUPLICATION_TESTING.md](./DEDUPLICATION_TESTING.md) for comprehensive deduplication results and testing methodology.
