## 📋 Overview

Nebula is an ambitious distributed file system project implemented in Rust that demonstrates advanced distributed systems concepts including:

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Files identified by their content hash rather than location
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized node network with no single point of failure
- **File Chunking**: Breaking large files into manageable pieces for efficient distribution
- **Distributed Hash Tables**: Kademlia-based DHT for efficient content routing
- **Data Deduplication**: Automatic detection and elimination of redundant data
- **Merkle Trees**: Cryptographic verification of file integrity

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in early development. Features are being implemented incrementally:

- [x] Project structure and planning
- [ ] Local node implementation
- [ ] Content-addressable storage
- [ ] File chunking and processing
- [ ] Peer-to-peer networking
- [ ] Distributed hash table
- [ ] Advanced features (deduplication, replication)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Rust**: For performance, memory safety, and concurrency
- **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime
- **libp2p**: Peer-to-peer networking framework
- **BLAKE3**: High-performance cryptographic hashing
- **Clap**: Command line argument parsing

## 📚 Architecture

Nebula is designed with the following core components:

- **Node Management**: Handles peer discovery and connections
- **Storage Layer**: Manages content-addressable local storage
- **File Processing**: Handles chunking, hashing, and merkle tree generation
- **Network Layer**: Manages peer communication and data transfer
- **DHT Implementation**: Provides distributed content routing
- **CLI**: User interface for interacting with the system
